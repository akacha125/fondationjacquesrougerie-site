        <p>After walking on the moon, it may soon be possible for scientists and astronauts to stay there thanks to the Eurohab lunar hut designed by Peter Weiss and the start-up Spartan Space. Awarded the Jacques Rougerie Foundation’s Architecture Prize in 2020, this accompany project to future lunar exploration missions was able to build its prototype inflatable and mobile structure with the ESA-European Space Agency and Air Liquide thanks to the Foundation’s network.</p>
