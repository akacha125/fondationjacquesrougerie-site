summary: >
  Jacques Rougerie has been an oceanographer-architect since the 1970s, when he pioneered his first underwater habitats. A life of passion and research that is now reflected in the SeaOrbiter project, a 57-metre-high vertical architectural structure, the upper part of which rises 27 metres above the waves.
