        <p><b>GRAND PRIX -Â </b><b>MARS REEF</b></p><p>The Mars agricultural units are assembled into a circular formation of a used pit crater, surrounded by the modular units to facilitate access by sub-terrestrial units. The agricultural land covering the crater will be the first Martian outdoor park, visible from all the surface units raised by tiny windows and accessible by the sub-terrestrial units.</p><p>Designed by Samer El Sayary | Egypt</p>
