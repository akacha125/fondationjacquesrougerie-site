        <p>Dans sa façon d’inviter les sujets à se rencontrer et à se confronter – l’art, l’architecture et le design, l’habitat et l’urbanisme, les enjeux sociétaux climatiques environnementaux, la géographie, l’esthétique, la physique, etc. – la Fondation Jacques Rougerie agit comme un espace de dialogue permanent entre les savoirs, à la portée de tous les publics.</p>
