        <p>Some of Jacques Rougerie's most original creations include the underwater houses Galathée (1977), Hippocampe (1981) and soon Seaspace (planned for 2010), all dreamed up, designed and tested by the architect himself. 2012 will see the completion of one of his flagship projects, the drifting vessel SeaOrbiter, which represents the culmination of years of research into an architecture concerned with sustainable development. Other notable projects include the Sea Pavilion in Kobe (1981), the Nausicaa I and II National Maritime Centre in Boulogne sur Mer (1990-2000), and Océanopolis I and II in Brest (1991-2000).<br>Other projects include the Underwater Archaeology Museum in Alexandria Bay (completed in 2013) and the Caribbean Sea Centre (completed in 2014).<br></p>
