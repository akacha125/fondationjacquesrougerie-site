        <p>The Jacques Rougerie Foundation organizes galas for its partners and sponsors, bringing together the sea and space community meet for a priviliged moment.

Auctions offer unforgettable experiences: a parabolic flight with astronaut Jean-François Clervoy, a two-day visit aboard the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier, a day at sea with yachtsman Loïk Peyron aboard one of the world's largest trimarans, a dive aboard a scientific submarine, a flight with astronaut Jean-Loup Chrétien aboard his plane...<br></p>
