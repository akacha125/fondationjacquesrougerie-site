            Jacques Rougerie's SeaOrbiter: a new architectural paradigm?
          summary: >-
            Jacques Rougerie has been an oceanographer-architect since the 1970s, when he pioneered his first underwater habitats. A life of passion and research that is now reflected in the SeaOrbiter project, a 57-metre-high vertical architectural structure, the upper part of which rises 27 metres above the waves.

          summary: >-
            Child of Cousteau, Gagarin and Jules Verne, oceanographer Jacques Rougerie has already lived a thousand lives. His major project for a ship to explore the seas has just been relaunched.
