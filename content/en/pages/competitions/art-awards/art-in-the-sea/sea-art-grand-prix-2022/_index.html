        <p><b>A short film paying tribute to women in a poetic underwater dance performance</b></p><p>Julie Gautier has built a new life. French freediving champion at the age of 26, she hung up her competitive fins in 2009 to give free rein to her artistic flair, in the service of a cause: protecting the oceans. Out of weariness and conviction, she realised that she would no longer thrive on breaking records: the time for the pursuit of performance was over. For over ten years now, Julie, self-taught and gifted, has been making films. It was her partner Guillaume Nery, twice world freediving champion, who put a camera in her hands: a revelation.  Her first film, "Free Fall", was released in 2010, in which she filmed freediving, following her partner as he free-falls into Dean's Blue Hole, the deepest blue hole in the world (-202 metres) on Long Island in the Bahamas. The film, which lasts just over 4 minutes, has been viewed more than 20 million times on the internet, familiarising the uninitiated with the spectral light of marine chasms.<br></p><p>Ama is the name of the fisherwomen in Japan who freedive to the depths to collect shellfish.<br></p>

        <p>Julie Gautier, born 19 November 1979, is a French freediver, director, model and dancer. She is apnea champion in the constant weight speciality.</p><p>Since the age of 26, she and her partner Guillaume Néry (world champion freedivers) have been creating artistic underwater videos that offer a new perspective on the marine world. Their strength comes from using freediving to work from either side of the camera. Being completely self-taught, she draws her inspiration from dance, comic strips and film.<br></p>
