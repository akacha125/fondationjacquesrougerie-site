            Sea Art Grand Prix 2020
          summary: >-
            Armed with his intuition and guided by his socially responsible approach to art, the artist Jérémy Gobé has come up with Corail Artefact: a global solution to combat the disappearance of coral reefs. To achieve this, he has drawn on his status as an individual artist to set up an entrepreneurial project to develop the project's research (artistic, scientific and industrial) and awareness-raising activities (for schools and the general public).
