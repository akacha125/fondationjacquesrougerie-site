        <p>All the roadmaps for space exploration include the Moon as the next step before a journey to Mars. Our presence on this satellite of the Earth in a permanent infrastructure would therefore be a real springboard for acquiring knowledge and operational experience before an even more distant exploration. In 2015, Jan Woerner, Director General of the European Space Agency (ESA), proposed the concept of a "Moon Village". This vision involves a gradual expansion of habitable infrastructure, adapted to multiple uses and different types of residents and users.</p><p>The lunar or Martian village will have to be imagined as an open, inclusive and sustainable project at the service of humanity, supporting international science, offering new opportunities for cooperation with space and non-space players, open to all nations and broadening the potential uses, whether industrial, commercial, tourist, educational or cultural.</p><p>On the Moon's surface, the absence of a protective atmosphere means that its surface is very hard and exposed to extreme temperatures (from - 110°C to + 130°C). The Moon is also regularly bombarded by meteorites. Its surface is covered with a fine dust coated by a vitreous shell that makes it highly abrasive, but also electrostatic due to its exposure to solar radiation waves. The Moon's gravity is 1/6th that of the Earth.</p><p>The purpose of the competition is to propose self-sufficient living systems that are independent of the Earth, using in situ resources as part of a circular economy approach. These closed-loop life-support systems will have to include the regulation of the atmosphere, the production of food and water, the recycling of waste and the equipment essential to life (exercise, mobility, etc.). These projects may be entered in one of two categories:</p><ul> <li>modular systems brought from Earth and assembled on site</li> <li>systems built in situ using local materials such as regolith, on the surface or in lava tunnels.</li> </ul>
