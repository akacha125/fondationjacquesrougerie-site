            "Along with my colleague Martin Garcia, we were immediately interested in the theme of rising sea levels proposed by the Jacques Rougerie Foundation competition. Architecture allows us to conceptualise and prepare the necessary adaptation to climate change. Taking part in this competition gave us the opportunity to share our vision of tomorrow's world. The competition has been a real springboard in our careers. Firstly through the recognition of our work, but above all thanks to the people we were able to meet, all united around architecture to reflect on the issues of tomorrow. It reinforced my desire to work on projects to adapt our territories to climate change."

            "My dream was to be part of the first generation of architects to design in space. This competition was a way of realising that dream: the motivation and inspiration it gave me inspired me to apply for other international competitions. It gave me a lot of hope for future construction in space. The Foundation is like an 'academy' now! I've been preparing for it every year for the last six years. I now teach young students about architecture in space."

        <p>The Earth and all its wonders are masterpieces in which we evolve. We cross territories, oceans, skies, stratospheres, and each time, we discover, the richness of their bodies, their structure, and the diversity of their forms, from the infinitely small to the infinitely large.</p><p> </p><p>We've opened our eyes to the treasures that fill our planet, their strength and elegance. In this era of tumultuous change, where climate, societies and the rights of living beings are constantly evolving, it's time to act with imagination. Let's observe, anticipate and act!</p><p> </p><p>Creators, thinkers, artists, engineers, you are the artisans of tomorrow! </p><p>Thanks to your boundless energy and burning passion, you are ready to shape a resilient future.</p><p> </p><p>In this 14th edition of the Prix de la Fondation, let’s push back the frontiers of audacity. Dare to dream, because today more than ever, your ideas can shape a better world.</p><p> </p><p>Take your inspiration from nature, that inexhaustible source of innovation. Biomimicry, fruit of 3.8 billion years of evolution, opens up unsuspected horizons. As Leonardo da Vinci said, "Take your lessons from nature: that's where our future lies".</p><p> </p><p>Your projects need to be bold, forward-looking and enthusiastic! Based on biomimicry, they must be rooted in the preservation of our ecosystems and their biodiversity. Designed in a multidisciplinary way, they demonstrate that inspiration, when combined with form, function and environment, can reach unsuspected heights.</p><p> </p><p>Let’s provide answers to the challenges of our century through the development of current and future technological, architectural, bio-inspired and artistic projects, in line with the major climatic and environmental issues relating in particular to coastlines and rising sea levels, as well as projects linked to the marine and space worlds.</p><p> </p><p>Open up new horizons, encouraging us to change paradigms and reconcile Humanity and Nature.</p><p><b> </b></p><p>                                  </p><p><b>Let's embark together towards a radiant future, where innovation and sustainability are our guiding principles.</b></p>
