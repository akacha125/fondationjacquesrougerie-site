            "Along with my colleague Martin Garcia, we were immediately interested in the theme of rising sea levels proposed by the Jacques Rougerie Foundation competition. Architecture allows us to conceptualise and prepare the necessary adaptation to climate change. Taking part in this competition gave us the opportunity to share our vision of tomorrow's world. The competition has been a real springboard in our careers. Firstly through the recognition of our work, but above all thanks to the people we were able to meet, all united around architecture to reflect on the issues of tomorrow. It reinforced my desire to work on projects to adapt our territories to climate change."

            "My dream was to be part of the first generation of architects to design in space. This competition was a way of realising that dream: the motivation and inspiration it gave me inspired me to apply for other international competitions. It gave me a lot of hope for future construction in space. The Foundation is like an 'academy' now! I've been preparing for it every year for the last six years. I now teach young students about architecture in space."

        <p>The Earth and all the wonders it creates are masterpieces in which we evolve. We cross territories, oceans, skies and stratospheres, each time discovering the richness of their bodies, their structure and the diversity of their forms, from the infinitely small to the infinitely large.</p><p>We have become aware of the treasures that populate and cover it, of their power and elegance. In these complex and uncertain times, major changes are affecting and overturning our planet. The climate, societies and the rights of living beings are all changing. We need to be imaginative. But above all, we must learn to observe in order to act. And to anticipate better.</p><p>Creators, thinkers, artists, talented women and men: the Planet is waiting for you!<strong>        </strong>   </p><p>For you who are enlightened and passionate, with the energy of your youth for some, and armed with what builds your convictions for others, and who wish to commit yourself to a resilient future, you can draw it and build it to last and withstand the shocks of a reordered and transformed modernity.</p><p>In 2023, for its 13th edition, the Foundation invites you to push the boundaries. Don’t be afraid to dream by daring, today more than ever. You can influence and propose reinvented living environments through architecture, a permanent field of creation and experimentation at the confluence of arts, sciences and technologies. Nature, a constant inspiration: biomimetics and its 3.8 billion years of evolution allow us to open and explore this new path of innovation. The great Leonardo da Vinci once said, <em>“Take your lessons from nature, that’s where our future is.”</em></p><p>Your projects must be bold, forward-looking. Enthusiastic more than normalized, they will show that inspiration, when it intersects form, function and environment, can lead a simple idea where it is not expected. Based primarily on biomimicry, in line with the safeguarding of our ecosystems and its biodiversity, they will have to be conceived and drawn in a multidisciplinary way.</p><p>We will be 10 billion by 2050. Three-quarters of the population will live near rivers and seashore and will be directly impacted by climate change, rising waters and erosion. As for the exploration of space, it is now inevitable and must be part of a transgenerational approach, conducive to other possibilities, and change paradigms to reconcile Humanity and Nature.</p>
