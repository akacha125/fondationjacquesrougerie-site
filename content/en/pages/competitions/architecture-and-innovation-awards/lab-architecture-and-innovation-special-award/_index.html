      THE FOUNDATION SUPPORTS SEAORBITER'S EDUCATIONAL SCIENCE PROGRAM

        <p>Imagined by Jacques Rougerie, this project, like the international space station ISS, is the first international station for the exploration and analysis of the ocean and its ecosystem, which is still poorly understood in many aspects. It is based on a unique operational principle and a strong symbolism that opens, for new generations, a field of scientific, educational and technological discoveries to refine the global knowledge of the oceans. It also represents a remarkable tool for improving predictive models. It will help respond in a better way to the current climate challenges and the impacts that this global change is having on our planet, its natural and socio-economic ecosystems.</p>

        <p>EUROHAB | After walking on the moon, it may soon be possible for scientists and astronauts to stay there thanks to the Eurohab lunar hut designed by Peter Weiss and the start-up Spartan Space. Awarded the Jacques Rougerie Foundation’s Architecture Prize in 2020, this accompany project to future lunar exploration missions was able to build its prototype inflatable and mobile structure with the ESA-European Space Agency and Air Liquide thanks to the Foundation’s network.</p>
