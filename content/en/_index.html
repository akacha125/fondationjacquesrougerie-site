            &quot; I realized my dreams thanks to women and men who believed in my vision of a prospective biomimetic, bio-inspired architecture and who helped me to implement it. Without them, many of these projects would not have been possible.  Today, I wish to communicate this passion that has always driven me by helping new generations to imagine their future and build their own dreams.  This is our commitment with the foundation, because it is from the ocean and space that the destiny of our civilization will come.”
