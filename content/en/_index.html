        <p>The ocean is our planet's most important resource, thanks to its multiple capacities to supply food, energy and healthcare. However, the seas are still poorly exploited to ensure a symbiosis with the needs of the whole of humanity. Entrants to the international architecture competition are invited to explore these issues using a free topic or one of the following themes: the coastline and the sea, the ports of the future, the village under the sea, the centre of the sea, etc. </p>
